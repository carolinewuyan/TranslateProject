11 Free and Open Source Video Editing Software
======

We’ve already covered the [top video editors for Linux][1]. That list contained some non-open source software as well. This made us write this article to feature only open source video editors. We’ve also mentioned what platforms are supported by these software so that this list is helpful even if you are not using Linux.

### Top Free and Open Source Video Editors

VidCutter is an open source video editor for basic tasks. It does not offer a plethora of features – but it works for all the common tasks like clipping or cutting. It’s under active development as well.

For Linux, it is available on Flathub as well. And, for Windows and Mac OS, you do get EXE and DMG file packages in the latest releases.

#### 6\. Flowblade

![][15]

**Key Features:**

Flowblade is an intuitive open source video editor available only for Linux. Yes, it is a bummer that we do not have cross-platform support for this.

However, if you are using a Linux distro, you can either download the .deb file and get it installed or use the source code on GitHub.

[Flowblade][17]

#### 7\. Avidemux

![][18]

**Key Features:**

  * Trim

If you are looking for a basic cross-platform open source video editor – this will be one of our recommendations. You just get the ability to cut, save, add a filter, and perform some other basic editing tasks. Their official [SourceForge page][19] might look like it has been abandoned, but it is in active development.

[Avidemux][19]

Blender is an advanced 3D creation suite. And, it is surprising that you get all those powerful abilities for free (and while being open source).

Of course, Blender is not a solution for every user – however, it is definitely one of the best open source tool available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can also find it on [Steam][25] to install it.

[Blender][26]

#### 10\. Cinelerra

![][27]

**Key Features:**

  * Advanced timeline
  * Motion tracking support
  * Video stabilization
  * Audio mastering
  * Color correction



**Platforms available on:** Linux

Cinelerra is a quite popular open source video editor. However, it has several branches to it (in other words – different versions). I am not sure if that is a good thing – but you get different features (and ability) on each of them.

Cinelerra GG, CV, CVE, and HV are those variants catering to users with different preferences. Personally, I would recommend to check out [Cinelerra GG][28].

[Cinelerra][29]

#### 11\. NATRON

**Key Features:**

  * VFX
  * Powerful Tracker
  * Keying tools for production needs
  * Shadertoy and G’mic tools

**Platforms available on** : Linux, macOS and Windows.

If you are into VFX and motion graphics, NATRON is a good alternative to Blender. Of course, in order to compare them for your usage, you will have to give it a try yourself.

You do have the installer available for Windows and the dmg package for Mac. So, it is quite easy to get it installed. You can always head to its [GitHub page][31] for more information.

**Wrapping Up**

So, now that you know about some of the most popular open source video editors available out there – what do you think about them?

Are they good enough for professional requirements? Or, did we miss any of your favorite open source video editor that deserved the mention?

I am not an expert video editor and have only experience with simple editing tasks to create YouTube videos. If you are an experienced and professional video editor, I would like to hear your opinion on how good are these open source video editors for the experts.
