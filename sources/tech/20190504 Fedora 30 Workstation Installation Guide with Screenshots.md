Fedora 30 Workstation Installation Guide with Screenshots
======

If you are a **Fedora distribution** lover and always try the things at Fedora Workstation and Servers, then it is good news for you as Fedora has released its latest OS edition as **Fedora 30** for the Workstation and Server. One of the important updates in Fedora 30 from its previous release is that it has introduced **Fedora CoreOS** as a replacement of Fedora Atomic host.

Some other noticeable updates in Fedora 30 are listed beneath:

  * Updated Desktop Gnome 3.32
  * New Linux Kernel 5.0.9
  * Updated Bash Version 5.0, PHP 7.3 & GCC 9
  * Updated Python 3.7.3, JDK12, Ruby 2.6 Mesa 19.0.2 and Golang 1.12
  * Improved DNF (Default Package Manager)



In this article we will walk through the Fedora 30 workstation Installation steps for laptop or desktop.

**Following are the minimum system requirement for Fedora 30 workstation,**

  * 1GHz Processor (Recommended 2 GHz Dual Core processor)
  * 2 GB RAM
  * 15 GB unallocated Hard Disk
  * Bootable Media (USB / DVD)
  * nternet Connection (Optional)



Let‚Äôs Jump into Installation steps,

### Step:1) Download Fedora 30 Workstation ISO File

Download the Fedora 30 Workstation ISO file on your system from its Official Web Site

<https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/>

Once the ISO file is downloaded, then burn it either in USB drive or DVD and make it bootable.

### Step:2) Boot Your Target System with Bootable media (USB Drive or DVD)

Reboot your target machine (i.e. machine where you want to install Fedora 30), Set the boot medium as USB or DVD from Bios settings so system boots up with bootable media.

### Step:3) Choose Start Fedora-Workstation-30 Live

When the system boots up with bootable media then we will get the following screen, to begin with installation on your system‚Äôs hard disk, choose ‚Äú **Start Fedora-Workstation-30 Live** ‚Äú,

### Step:4) Select Install to Hard Drive Option

Select ‚Äú **Install to Hard Drive** ‚Äù option to install Fedora 30 on your system‚Äôs hard disk, you can also try Fedora on your system without installing it, for that select ‚Äú **Try Fedora** ‚Äù Option

Click on Continue

### Step:6) Choose Installation destination and partition Scheme

In the next window we will be present the following screen, here we will choose our installation destination, means on which hard disk we will do installation

In the next screen we will see the local available hard disk, select the disk that suits your installation and then choose how you want to create partitions on it from storage configuration tab.

If you choose ‚Äú **Automatic** ‚Äù partition scheme, then installer will create the necessary partition for your system automatically but if you want to create your own customize partition scheme then choose ‚Äú **Custom** ‚Äù option,

<https://www.linuxtechi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Custom-Partition-Fedora-30-installation.jpg>

Click on Done

In this article I will demonstrate how to create [**LVM**][1] based custom partitions, in my case I have around 40 GB unallocated hard drive, so I will be creating following partitions on it,

  * /boot = 2 GB (ext4 file system)
  * /home = 15 GB (ext4 file system)
  * /var = 10 GB (ext4 file system)
  * / = 10 GB (ext4 file system)
  * Swap = 2 GB



<https://www.linuxtechi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LVM-Partition-MountPoint-Fedora-30-Installation.jpg>

Select ‚Äú **LVM** ‚Äù as partitioning scheme and then click on plus (+) symbol,

Specify the mount point as /boot and partition size as 2 GB and then click on ‚ÄúAdd mount point‚Äù

<https://www.linuxtechi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/boot-standard-parttion-fedora-30.jpg>

Now create next partition as /home of size 15 GB, Click on + symbol

<https://www.linuxtechi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/home-partition-fedora-30-installation.jpg>

Click on ‚Äú **Add mount point** ‚Äù

<https://www.linuxtechi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Modify-Volume-Group-Fedora30-Installation.jpg>

If you might have noticed, /home partition is created as LVM partition under default Volume Group, if you wish to change default Volume Group name then click on ‚Äú **Modify** ‚Äù option from Volume Group Tab,

Mention the Volume Group name you want to set and then click on Save. Now onward all the LVM partition will be part of fedora30 volume group.

Similarly create the next two partitions **/var** and **/** of size 10 GB respectively,

**/var partition:**

<https://www.linuxtechi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/var-partition-fedora30-installation.jpg>

**/ (slash) partition:**

<https://www.linuxtechi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/slash-partition-fedora30-installation.jpg>

Now create the last partition as swap of size 2 GB,

<https://www.linuxtechi.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Swap-partition-fedora30-installation.jpg>

In the next window, click on Done
