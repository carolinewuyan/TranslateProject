Clementine Music Player for All Your Audio Needs
======

[VLC][1] is a mainstay for most fans of FOSS technology and most Linux distros. It’s a great little player, don’t get me wrong, but if you have a large library of audio files, some times you need something more powerful.

The [Clementine Music Player][2] is a full-service audio player with all the tools you need to keep track of your audio library. According to the [project’s website][3], Clementine “inspired by Amarok 1.4, focusing on a fast and easy-to-use interface for searching and playing your music.”

In Ubuntu, Clementine is available in the [Universe repository][8]. You can [use the apt command][9] in this fashion:

```
sudo apt install clementine
```

In Fedora, you can use this command:

```
sudo dnf clementine
```

In Manjaro or other Arch-based distributions, you can use:

```
sudo pacman -S clementine
```

You can find a list of Linux distros that have Clementine in their repos [here][10]. You can also download packages directly from the [Clementine site][11].

If you have a Windows system, you can download a .exe from the [project’s download page][11].

### Experience with Clementine music player

I have installed Clementine on multiple Linux and Windows systems. I have a large collection of Old Time Radio shows, audio drama, and some music. Clementine does a good job of keeping it all organized.

![Clementine Library][12]

I also used it to download and listen to podcasts. It worked well for that. However, I did not use that part very much.

I didn’t use the cloud options because I don’t trust the cloud with my audio stuff.

### Final Thoughts on Clementine

I like Clementine. I installed it on multiple systems. I only used a small portion of the wide range of tools it offers and they worked great.

The only thing that concerns me is that the developers haven’t updated the project in three years. The [project’s GitHub page][14] has almost 2,000 open issues and 40 pending pull requests. I can understand that the developers might think that the project is stable and mature, but it looks like some users are having issues that are not being addressed.

I guess this is the reason why Clementine has been forked into [Strawberry music player][15].

If you are looking for an audio management program that is updated regularly, you may check out [Sayonara music player][16].
