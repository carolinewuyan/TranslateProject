Spotify is known to be one of the best apps to stream online music. Spotify allows you to stream music and when you are offline, you can listen to your local files on your machine. Your music is organised into various genres to which the music belongs. Spotify allows you to see what your friends are listening to and also try them out yourself. The app looks great and is well organized, it is easy to search for songs. All you have to do is type into the search box and Wallah! You get the music you are searching for online.

​The app is cross-platform and allows you to stream your favorite tunes. There are some catches though. You will need to create an account with Spotify to use the app. You can do so using Facebook or your email. You also have a choice to upgrade to premium which will be worth your money since you have access to high quality music and you can listen to music from any of your devices. Apparently Spotify is not available in every country. You can install Spotify by typing the following commands in the terminal:
