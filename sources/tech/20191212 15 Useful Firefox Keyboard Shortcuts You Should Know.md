15 Useful Firefox Keyboard Shortcuts You Should Know
======

[Firefox][1] is one of the most popular free and open-source browsers for Linux users. Even though you have a lot of [open source chrome alternatives][2], Firefox still is one of the best choices to go with.

And you don’t even need to [install Firefox on Ubuntu][3] or most other distributions because it is installed by default.

What if you can make your browsing experience on Firefox even better by using some keyboard shortcuts?

Hold on, of course, not everyone prefers to use keyboard shortcuts. But, if you’re comfortable with that and want to do perform tasks in a jiffy, you should know some of the most common Firefox keyboard shortcuts.

It is also worth noting that you could use some of these shortcuts on Chrome/Chromium as well- however, we already have a list of [useful Google Chrome shortcuts][4] to help you out. So, if you’re using Chrome/Chromium, I insist you check out that article.

### 15 Useful Firefox Keyboard Shortcuts

![][5]

You could always refer to the [official documentation][6] of keyboard shortcuts for Firefox. However, that’s a very long list, and you probably do not need to use all of that.

So, here, I shall be listing the most commonly used (and useful) keyboard shortcuts that you can use on Firefox. To be honest, these are the shortcuts that I use most frequently on Firefox.

#### 1\. Open A New Tab

You don’t have to hover your cursor over to the **+** sign in the browser.

Simply press **CTRL + T** to open a new tab in the same window.

#### 2\. Open A New Tab In A New Window

If you want to open up a new window along with a new tab, you just have to press **CTRL + N**.

#### 3\. Close A Tab

Lazy to use your mouse to navigate and close the tab? Fret not, just press **CTRL + W** to make your active tab vanish!

#### 4\. Open A New Private Window

Don’t want to store the history/cookies for a specific browsing session? You can try the private mode by pressing **CTRL + Shift + P** as the keyboard shortcut for Firefox.

#### 5\. Open Recently Closed Tabs

If you closed a tab recently (or a number of tabs), just press **CTRL + Shift + T** till you get all your closed tabs restored.

#### 6\. Reload Webpage

You might want to reload a webpage quickly, to do that press **F5**.

If you want to ignore the cached content and want to fetch a new copy of the webpage, you can try **CTRL + F5**.

#### 7\. Scroll Up/Down Webpage

You can also scroll up/down using just your keyboard.

Simply use **PAGE UP** to scroll up and **PAGE DOWN** key to scroll down.

#### 8\. Find A Text In Webpage

You do not need to endlessly look for a word on a webpage just like you would in a physical book.

Simply press **CTRL + F** and then type in the exact word, it should highlight the matching words if it exists.

#### 9\. Close Your Browser At Once

Hit **CTRL + Shift + W** to close all the tabs in one go. However, you might get the prompt to confirm it.

#### 10\. View The Page Source

If you’re interested to take peek at the webpage’s source code, you just have to press **CTRL + U** to open view source in a new tab.

#### 11\. Switch Tabs Quickly

If you have multiple tabs opened up, you can easily navigate through them by pressing:

**CTRL + Tab**.

#### 12\. View Your Downloads

Do you want to quickly take a look at your download library? All you need to do is press:

**CTRL + Shift + Y**

#### 13\. Bookmark A Webpage

To bookmark a webpage, hit **CTRL + D** and press the **ENTER** key to save it.

#### 14\. Select the Address/Search Bar

If you want to search for something through the address bar, hit **CTRL + L** to immediately highlight the search bar for you.

#### 15\. Check Browsing History

Usually, it needs a couple of clicks to view your history. But, you can just press **CTRL + H** to launch the sidebar to view your history right away.

### Wrapping Up

As I mentioned, you will find a huge list of Firefox keyboard shortcuts if you take a look at their [official documentation][6].

If you want to explore more options, feel free to check the documentation. In either case, the mentioned keyboard shortcuts should come pretty handy.
