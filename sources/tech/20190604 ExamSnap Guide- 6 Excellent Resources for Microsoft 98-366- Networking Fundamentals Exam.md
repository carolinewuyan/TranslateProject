The Microsoft 98-366 exam is almost similar to the CompTIA Network+ certification test when it comes to its content.

It is also known as Networking Fundamentals, and its purpose is to assess your knowledge of switches, routers, OSI models, wide area and local area networks, wireless networking, and IP addressing.

Those who pass the exam earn the MTA (Microsoft Technology Associate) certificate. This certifications an ideal entry-level credential to help you begin your IT career.

### 6 Resources for Microsoft MTA 98-366 Exam

Using approved training materials is the best method to prepare for your certification exam. Most candidates are fond of shortcuts and often use PDFs and brain dumps to prepare for the test.

It is important to note that these materials need additional study methods. They will not help you gain better knowledge that is meant to make you perform better at work.

When you take your time to master the course contents of a certification exam, you are not only getting ready for the test but also developing your skills, expertise, and knowledge in the topics covered there.
