How To Type Indian Rupee Sign (₹) In Linux
======

This brief guide explains how to type Indian Rupee sign in Unix-like operating systems. The other day, I wanted to type **“Indian Rupee Sign (₹)”**. My keyboard has rupee symbol on it, but I didn’t know how to type it. After a few google searches, I found a way to do this. If you ever wondered how to type rupee symbol in Linux, follow the steps given below.

### Type Indian Rupee Sign In Linux

The default keyboard layout in most GNU/Linux and other operating systems is **English (US)**. To type Indian rupee symbol, you need to change the Keyboard layout to **English (India, with rupee)**. I have given the steps to do this in three Desktop environments – **GNOME** , **MATE** and **KDE Plasma**. However, the steps are same for other DEs and other operating systems as well. Just find where the Keyboard layout settings is and change the layout to English (India, with rupee sign).

##### In GNOME Desktop Environment:

I tested this on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS desktop. This may work on other Linux distros with GNOME DE.

Click the drop down arrow on the top right corner of your Ubuntu desktop and choose **Settings** icon in the bottom left corner.

Launch System’s settings from top panel

From the Settings section, click on **Region & Language** option in the left pane. Then click the **+** (plus) sign button on the right side under **Input Sources** tab.

![][3]

Region & language section in Settings section

In the next window, click on the **three vertical dots** button and choose the input language you’d like to add from the list.

![][4]

Add input source in Ubuntu

Scroll down a bit and search for **English (India)**. Click on it and then select **English (India, with rupee)** from list and finally click Add button.

![][5]

Choose “English (India, with rupee)” option

You will see it under Input Sources tab. If you want to make it as default, just choose it and click “UP” arrow button.

Close the Settings window and Log off and Log in back once.

Now choose the “English (India, with rupee)” from the language drop down box on the top bar of your Ubuntu desktop.

![][6]

Choose “English (India, with rupee)” option

Alternatively, you can use **SUPER+SPACE** keys from the Keyboard to choose it.

Choose “English (India, with rupee)” option using super+space keys

Now, you can be able to type Indian rupee symbol by pressing **“Right ALT+4”**.

If your keyboard has the **AltGr key** on it, then press **AltGr+4** to type Indian rupee symbol.

Alternatively, you can use the key combination **“CTRL+SHIFT+u+20b9”** to type rupee symbol (Just hold CTRL+SHIFT keys and type **u20b9** letters and leave the keys). This will work everywhere.

##### In MATE Desktop Environment:

If you use MATE DE, go to **System - > Preferences -> Hardware -> Keyboard** from the Menu. Then, click on **Layouts** tab and click **Add** button to add a Indian keyboard layout.

![][8]

Add Keyboard layout in Keyboard preferences

Choose **India** from Country drop-down box and **Indian English (India, with rupee)** from Variants drop-down box. Click Add to add the chosen layout.

![][9]

Choose Indian English (India, with rupee) option

The Indian layout will be added to the Keyboard layout section. Choose it and click “Move up” to make it as default. Then, click “Options” button to choose the Keyboard layout options.

![][10]

From the Keyboard layout options windows, click on “Key to choose the 3rd level” and choose a key of your choice to apply for rupee symbol. I have chosen **“Any Alt”** key (So, I can use either left or right ALT keys).

![][11]

Close the keyboard preferences window.

Now, you can be able to type Indian rupee symbol by pressing **“ALT+4”**. Alternatively, you can use the key combination **“CTRL+SHIFT+u+20b9”** to type rupee symbol (Just hold CTRL+SHIFT keys and type **u20b9** letters and leave the keys). This will work everywhere.

Please note that this will work, only if your keyboard has **₹** symbol on **4**. If your keyboard doesn’t has this symbol or very old, it won’t work.

##### On KDE Plasma desktop environment:

If you use KDE Plasma, go to **Application Launcher - > System Settings -> Hardware -> Input Devices -> Keyboard -> Layouts**.

Check the box “Configure Layouts” and click “Add”.

![][12]

Choose “Indian” from Layout drop-down box and “English (India, rupee sign”) from Variant drop-down box.

![][13]

The chosen layout will be added to Layouts section. Choose it and click “Move up” to make it as default keyboard layout.

Then, click **Advanced** and click **“Key to choose the 3rd level”** and choose a key of your choice to apply for rupee symbol. I have chosen **“Any Alt”** key. Finally, click **“Apply”**.

![][14]

Now, you can be able to type Indian rupee symbol by pressing **“ALT+4”**. This procedure is same for all other DEs. All you have to do is find where keyboard layout is and change the layout to **English (India, rupee sign)**.
