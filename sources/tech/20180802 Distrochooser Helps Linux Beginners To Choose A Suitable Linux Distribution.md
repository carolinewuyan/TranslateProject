### Results?

I didn’t believe Distrochooser will exactly find what I am looking for. Oh boy, I was wrong! To my surprise, it did indeed a good job. The results were almost accurate to me. I was expecting Arch Linux in the result and indeed it was my top recommendation, followed by 11 other recommendations such as NixOS, Void Linux, Qubes OS, Scientific Linux, Devuan, Gentoo Linux, Bedrock Linux, Slackware, CentOS, Linux from scratch and Redhat Enterprise Linux. Totally, I got 12 recommendations and each result is very detailed along with distribution’s description and home page link for each distribution.

I posted Distrochooser link on Reddit and 80% of the users could be able to find suitable Linux distribution for them. However, I won’t claim Distrochooser alone is enough to find good results for everyone. Some users disappointed about the survey result and the result wasn’t even close to what they use or want to use. So, I strongly recommend you to consult other Linux experts, websites, forums before trying any Linux. You can read the full Reddit discussion [**here**][3].

What are you waiting for? Go to the Distrochooser site and choose a suitable Linux distribution for you.

And, that’s all for now, folks. More good stuffs to come. Stay tuned!

Cheers!
