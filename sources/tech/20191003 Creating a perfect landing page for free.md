**A landing page is a must for every online business**

The concept of landing pages arrived a few years back but these few years were enough to settle down and become the necessity of every online business. At the beginning loads of businessmen decided to ignore their existence and preferred to persuade themselves that a homepage is already enough. Well, sorry to break it for them – but it’s not.

**Homepage should never equal landing page**

Obviously, a homepage is also a must for every online business and without it the business can only exist in entrepreneur’s imagination ;-) However, an essence of a homepage is not the same what an essence of a landing page is. And even the most state-of-the-art business website does not replace a good piece of landing page.

Homepages do serve multiple purposes but none of them is focused on attracting new clients as they don’t clearly encourage visitors to take an action such as subscribing or filling out a contact form. Homepages’ primary focus is the company itself – its full offer, history or founder and it makes them full of distracting information and links. And last but not least, the information on them is not put in order that would make the visitors desire the product instantly.

**Landing pages impose action**

Landing page is a standalone website and serves as a first-impression maker among the visitors. It is the place where your new potential customers land and in order to keep them you need to show them instantly that your solution is something they need. It should quickly grab attention of the visitors, engage them in an action and make them interested in your product or service. And it should do all of that as quickly as possible.

Therefore, landing pages are a great tool which helps you increase your conversion rate, getting information about your visitors, engage new potential leads into action (such as subscribing for a free trial or a newsletter what provide you with personal information about them) and make them believe your product or service is worthwhile. However, in order to fulfill all these functions it needs to have all the necessary landing page elements and it has to be a landing page of high quality.

**Every landing page needs some core features**
In order to create a perfectly converting landing page you need to plan its structure and put all the essential elements on it that will help you achieve your goals. The core elements that should be placed on every landing page are:

  * headlines which should be catchy, keywords focused and eye-catching. It is the first, and sometimes only, element that visitors read so it has to be well-thought and a little intriguing,
  * subheadlines which should be completion of headlines, a little bit more descriptive but still keywords focused and catchy,
  * benefits of your solution clearly outlined and demonstrating high value and absolute necessity of purchasing it for your potential leads,
  * call-to-action in a visible place and allowing the visitors to subscribe for a free trial, coupons, a newsletter or purchase right away.



All of these features put together in a right order enable you to boost your conversions and make your product or service absolutely desirable for your customers. They are all the core elements of every landing page and without any of them there is a higher risk of landing page failure.

However, putting all the elements is one thing but designing a landing page is another. When planning its structure you should always have in mind who your target is and adjust your landing page look accordingly. You should always keep up with landing page trends which make your landing page up-to-date and appealing for the customers.
